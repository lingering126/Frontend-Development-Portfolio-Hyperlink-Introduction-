            <p>
              In this section I will explain hyperlinks' definition and their
              types.
            </p>
            <h2>Definition</h2>
            <p>
              In computing, a hyperlink, or simply a link, is a digital
              reference to data that the user can follow or be guided to by
              clicking or tapping.
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink#:~:text=In%20computing%2C%20a%20hyperlink%2C%20or,is%20known%20as%20anchor%20text."
                >[1]</a>
              A hyperlink points to a whole document or to a specific element
              within a document. A user can easily follow, jump to, and be
              directed to the destination by either clicking, tapping on, or
              hovering over the link.
            </p>
            <p>
              A hyperlink can be a piece of text, an image, an icon, or a
              graphic that, when you click on it, points to and navigates you to
              a different webpage or document. It can also point to a specific
              section or element within the same webpage or document. The linked
              text is known as “anchor text“.
            </p>
            <p>
              Basically, hyperlinks are clickable pointers to a resource.<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-a-hyperlink-definition-for-html-link-beginners/">[2]</a>
              For instance, hyperlink is a hyperlink, which will direct you to
              the Wikipedia of “hyperlink”. And the document who contains
              hyperlinks is source document, while the hyperlink leads you to
              target document.
            </p>
            <h2>Types of hyperlinks</h2>
            <h3 class="bullet-heading">Internal Hyperlinks</h3>
            <p>
              An internal hyperlink links two pages inside the same website. For
              example, <a href="#history">history of hyperlink</a> is an
              internal hyperlink which leads you to the next page of this
              website.
            </p>
            <h3 class="bullet-heading">External Hyperlink</h3>
            <p>
              An external hyperlink links one website to another website. For
              example,
              <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp"
                >HTML Links</a
              >
              is an external hyperlink which leads you from this website to
              w3school website.
            </p>
            <p>
              Besides internal hyperlink and external hyperlink, you can
              categorize hyperlinks by their forms
            </p>
            <h3 class="bullet-heading">Text Hyperlink</h3>
            <p>
              The hyperlink is embedded into a word or phrase which makes it
              clickable. The examples above are text links.
            </p>
            <h3 class="bullet-heading">Image Hyperlink</h3>
            <p>
              The hyperlink is embedded into a image which makes it clickable.
              For instance, click this picture of Vision Pro, you will be led to
              a txt file introducing Vision Pro which is copied from Wikipedia.
            </p>
            <div class="image-container">
              <a href="./documents/Apple_Vision_Pro_Wikipedia.txt"
                ><img
                  src="./images/Vision-pro.jpeg"
                  alt="the image link of Apple Vision Pro"></a
              ><span class="reference"
                ><a

                ></span
              >
            </div>
            <h3 class="bullet-heading">Anchor Hyperlink</h3>
            <p>
              Anchor hyperlinks bring user from one place in a website to
              another place, just like the example shown in “internal link”.
            </p>
            <h3 class="bullet-heading">Fat Hyperlink</h3>
            <p>A fat hyperlink leads to multiple destinations.</p>
            <h1>How do hyperlinks work?</h1>
            <p>
              In this section I will explain how are hyperlinks implemented in
              web developers' perspectives and browsers perspectives.
            </p>
            <h2>How do developers create an HTML hyperlink?</h2>
            <h3>Example 1: Text link</h3>
            <p>This is a basic syntax of HTML link.</p>
            <img
              id="basic-syntax"
              src="./images/example1-1.png"
              alt="a basic syntax of HTML link"
            >
            <p>
              The <code>a</code> defines a hyperlink, <code>href</code> stands
              for hypertext reference, followed by “./images/iPhone 15.jpg” ,
              which is the location of the target document, “iPhone 15” is the
              hypertext.
            </p>
            <p>
              Usually the hypertext is inside a paragraph, so you should put the
              <code>a</code> element inside a paragraph like this.
            </p>
            <img src="./images/example1-2.png" alt="link inside a paragraph">
            <p>This is a demo of how it works.</p>
            <video controls>
              <source src="./videos/example1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            </video>
            <!--insert video.-->
            <h3>Example 2: Image link</h3>
            <p>
              To create an image link, you should add the image inside anchor
              element
            </p>
            <img src="./images/example2.png" alt="demo code of a image link">
            <p>
              In this case, click the image and then you will get the
              iPhone15.doc document.
            </p>
            <video controls>
              <source src="./videos/example2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            </video>
            <h3>Example 3: target attribute</h3>
            <p>
              In the examples above, when you click the link, the browser will
              open the same tab. That's browser's default way to open a link.
              What should you do if you want to make the link opened in a new
              tab? You need to specify the <code>target</code> attribute.
              <code>target</code> has 4 values:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>_self:</b> This is default one. When you click the link, the
                link will be opened in the same tab.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>_blank:</b> When you click the link, the link will be opened
                in a new tab.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <img
              src="./images/example3.png"
              alt="demo code of _blank value of target"
            >
            <video controls>
              <source src="./videos/example3.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            </video>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>_top:</b> Opens the document in the full body of the window
              </li>
              <li><b>_parent:</b> Opens the document in the parent frame</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>How are HTML links implemented in browsers?</h2>
            <p>
              To explain how hyperlinks are implemented in browsers, I will
              break it down into step-by-step progress.
            </p>
            <h3>Step 1: Parsing the anchor tag</h3>
            <p>
              When you click the link, the browser encounters the anchor tag
              with the <i>href</i> attribute and parse it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then there are two different conditions. If the link refers to a
              local file, it does not need to send an HTML request. For example,
            </p>
            <img
              src="./images/example1-1.png"
              alt="demo code of a basic HTML link"
            >
            <p>
              In this case, the browser constructs the local file path based on
              the specified path(./images/iPhone 15.jpg) in the
              <i>href</i> attribute, and then access it through user's local
              filesystem, and then render it.
            </p>
            <p class="text-primary">
              However, if the link refers to a document on Internet, it needs to
              send an HTML request and the steps are as follows:
            </p>
            <img
              src="./images/overview-HTML-link.png"
              alt="HTML implementation overview"
            >
            <p>
              The step 2-6 shown on the overview picture will be described in
              more details later. Before we started, we should have some
              prerequisite knowledge about the html link. Take the webpage
              w3schools HTML introduction
            </p>
            <img
              src="./images/link-example.png"
              alt="w3schools url as example"
            >
            <p>
              as example. We can break the link down into several components:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>(1) Protocol: <b>https://</b></li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  The protocol indicates the method used for accessing the
                  resource on the web. In this case, it's HTTPS (Hypertext
                  Transfer Protocol Secure), which is the secure version of
                  HTTP. HTTPS encrypts the data exchanged between the user's
                  browser and the website, providing a secure connection.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>(2) Domain/Subdomain: <b>www.w3schools.com</b></li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  This part of the URL identifies the domain name of the
                  website. In this case, it's <i>w3schools.com</i>. The
                  <i>.com</i> is TLD ( top-level domain) refers to commercial
                  organizations.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>(3) Path: <b>/html/html_intro.asp</b></li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  The path specifies the location of the specific resource (in
                  this case, a web page) on the server's filesystem. In this
                  URL, the path is <i>/html/html_intro.asp</i>. It indicates
                  that the server should look for a file named "html_intro.asp"
                  within a directory named html.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Step 2: Browser looks up IP address for the domain</h3>
            <p>
              After you clicked the html link, the browser needs to look for
              which server on the internet to connect to. To achieve this, it
              needs to look up the IP address of the server hosting the website
              using the domain you typed in. It does this using a DNS lookup<a
                href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/what-happens-when-you-type-a-url-into-your-browser/"
                >[4]</a
              >. The DNS look up is like looking up phone number in your contact
              app, the IP address is the phone number, the domain name is the
              contact's name, and the DNS (domain name system) is the contact
              app which records the contacts' names and their numbers.
            </p>
            <p>
              To reduce latency, the browser will check cache(memory) first. If
              the browser can't find IP address on cache, then DNS lookup
              begins. The steps are shown in the picture below.
            </p>
            <img
              src="./images/DNS_lookup.png"
              alt="a demonstration of DNS lookup"
            >
            <h3>Step 3: Browser initiates TCP connection with the server</h3>
            <p>
              After the browser get the IP address of the server, it starts to
              establish TCP connection as shown below.
            </p>
            <div class="image-container">
              <img src="./images/handshake.png" alt="handshake of TCP"><span
                class="reference"
                ><a
                  href="https://www.coengoedegebure.com/tcp-3-way-handshake-port-scanning/"
                  >[5]</a
                ></span
              >
            </div>
            <!--add a div to add the index near the image-->
            <h3>Step 4: Browser sends the HTTP request to the server.</h3>
            <div class="image-container">
              <img src="./images/http-requests.webp" alt="HTTP request"><span
                class="reference"
                ><a href="https://www.jcchouinard.com/http-requests/"
                  >[6]</a
                ></span
              >
            </div>
            <p>
              Once the TCP connection is established, the browser has connected
              to the server, and it follows the rules of communication for
              HTTP(s) protocol. It begins with the browser sending an HTTP
              request to the server to request the contents of the page. The
              HTTP request contains 3 components: request line, headers and body
            </p>
            <h4>Request Line</h4>
            <img
              src="./images/request_line.png"
              alt="an example of HTTP request line"
            >
            <p>
              The request line specifies the http method (get in the example),
              path to the requested resource(URL). There are several types of
              method as the table shown below.
            </p>
            <table class="table table-hover">
              <tr>
                <th>HTML request methods</th>
                <th>Descriptions</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>GET</td>
                <td>
                  Requests a representation of the specified resource. GET
                  requests should only retrieve data and not modify anything on
                  the server.

            <h4 style="padding-top: 10px">Request Headers</h4>
            <p>
              The headers pass extra information along from the client that help
              route the request, indicate what type of client is making the
              request (the user agent), path, accept-encoding (supported
              encoding methods), cookies, etc.

            <h4>Request Body</h4>
            <p>
              The request body is usually empty for a GET request like the
              example. For a request that handles resources, like POST, PUT or
              PATCH, the body will contain the data from the client to create or
              update.

            <h4>XMLHttpRequest</h4>
            <p>
              Nowadays, modern browsers use XMLHttpRequest to interact with
              servers. You can retrieve data from a URL without having to do a
              full page refresh. This enables a Web page to update just part of
              a page without disrupting what the user is doing. It allows client
              to script data transfers via JavaScript. Here are some examples
              for you.
            </p>
            <h5 class="bullet-heading"><b>GET request</b></h5>
            <img src="./images/GET.png" alt="an example of GET">
            <p>
              <code>GET </code> is an method used to retrieve data from a
              server. The first line requests data from the w3schools link. The
              third parameter to<code> open</code>is whether the request should
              be asynchronous. <code>true</code> means JavaScript code will
              continue to execute while waiting for the server's response. This
              is generally preferred to avoid blocking the browser's UI.
            </p>
            <p>
              <code>send()</code> is the method sends the related request to
              server.
            </p>
            <h5 class="bullet-heading"><b>POST request</b></h5>
            <p>A POST request is used to create or alter data on the server.</p>
            <img src="./images/POST.png" alt="an example of POST">
            <p>
              In this example, <code>POST</code> request sends the data
              <code>"name=Thomas&age=31"</code> to the server.
            </p>
            <h5 class="bullet-heading"><b>PUT request</b></h5>
            <p>
              A PUT request is used to replace data on the server. It must be
              idempotent, which means if you send the same PUT or DELETE request
              multiple times, the result should be the same as sending it once.

            <p>
              Ajax is short for "Asynchronous JavaScript and XML" is a set of
              web development techniques that uses various web technologies on
              the client-side to create asynchronous web applications. With
              Ajax, web applications can send and retrieve data from a server
              asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the
              display and behaviour of the existing page.<a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)"

            </p>
            <p>
              AJAX communicates with the server using XMLHttpRequest object.
              Let's try to understand the flow of ajax or how ajax works by the
              image displayed below.
            </p>

            <p>
              As you can see in the above example, XMLHttpRequest object plays a
              important role.

            <ol>
              <li>

                  User sends a request from the UI and a javascript call goes to
                  XMLHttpRequest object.

              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  HTTP Request is sent to the server by XMLHttpRequest object.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Server interacts with the database using JSP, PHP, Servlet,
                  ASP.net etc.

              <li>
                <p>
                  Server sends XML data or JSON data to the XMLHttpRequest
                  callback function.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>

              This is an example of AJAX. It makes a call to a public API, get
              data (JSON data in this example) from server and display without

            </div>
            <p>
              After receiving the response from servers, the browser starts to

                <p>1. Parse the HTML</p>
                <p>
                  When the browser receives the HTML document, it starts parsing
                  the HTML to DOM(Document Object Model), which represents the
                  structure of the webpage.
                </p>

                <p>2. Parse the CSS to construct CSSOM(CSS Object Model)</p>
                <p>
                  The browser simultaneously parses the linked CSS files and
                  constructs the CSSOM, which represents the styles applied to
                  the webpage.
                </p>

                <p>3. Create Render Tree</p>
                <p>
                  Once both the DOM and CSSOM are constructed, the browser
                  combines them to create the render tree.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>4. Calculate layout and paint</p>
                <p>
                  Upon completed render tree, the browser knows what to render.
                  And then it calculates the layout, knowing where to render.
                  Finally, take the layout information and paint the pixels to
                  the screen.<a

                    <p>
                      The term 'hypertext' (which gave birth to the term
                      'hyperlink') was originally coined by the pre-internet
                      pioneer Ted Nelson in 1963.

                      He defined a hyperlink as a selectable reference to
                      another piece of information. His vision of a computer
                      network where documents could be interconnected gave birth
                      to a prototype known as Project Xanadu.<a

                    <p>
                      Though the concept of hyperlink conceived in 1960s, it is
                      only used within some researchers, until the invention of
                      World Wide Web make it become tangible. In 1989, a British
                      scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented World Wide Web which
                      includes the building block HTML (Hypertext markup
                      language). HTML is a text format to represent hypertext
                      documents. It create standards for creating and linking
                      documents on World Wide Web. And the
                      <code>a</code> element (I think you have been familiar
                      with it) is introduced in HTML 2.0, which allows
                      developers to add hyperlinks between webpages.

                      After the invention of WWW, the importance of hyperlinks

                      for embedding hyperlinks within a webpage, which made
                      hyperlinks accessible to a boarder users.

                      Request for Comments that acknowledged the existence of
                      URLs and URNs. URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) provides
                      a means of locating and retrieving information resources
                      on a network.

                  the button style from basic to "btn-primary" of bootstrap5. I
                  input the options and the right answer. I changed the style to
                  make it adaptive to the webpage.
